## Credits

*   Peter VK3YE and his you tube movie "Your first radio transmitter you built yourself (no soldering, 500km range), got me into the idea of building cw transmitter. Peters youtube channel was one of the main reasons of me getting into ham radio! Baseband oscillator in this project is based on Peter's design.
*   Peter N6QW and his internet post "IRF510 Final Amplifier Stage" is a base of RF amplifier incorporated in this design
*   Pawel SP2FP and his internet post "LPF 50-100W" (original: Filtry dolnoprzepustowe 50-100W), has been used to construct 80m LPF filter, which is part of this project.
*   Andrzej SP5AHT and his article in Elektronika dla Wszystkich 1/99 titled HF Power Amplifier (original: Wzmacniach Mocy KF) provided further enhancments to design described in Peters N6QW post.
*   Gerry Kavanagh for great CW keyer utility in Python
